### [Oddworks Content Server](https://github.com/oddnetworks/oddworks)
The Oddworks iOS/tvOS SDK is designed specifically as a client for the open source Oddworks Content Server. Together the server and client allow you to structure your content and deliver it specifically to your application.

### [Oddworks Sample Apps](https://github.com/oddnetworks/odd-sample-apps)
The sample apps are designed as reference apps for creating content rich applications for iOS and Apple TV. These are open source as well, and should provide the quickest way to get started with this SDK for your app.

Motivation
----------
The Oddworks Platform was designed and developed by [Odd Networks](https://www.oddnetworks.com/) to lower the barrier for developers and content owners to create your own streaming content network.

We proudly stand behind our open source work and, in addition to maintaining the Oddworks project, Odd Networks also provides hosted services, a Pro Dashboard, a Live Stream Generator, and a Recommendation Service.
